# Why a basic node server is important

### Browser Initiates a Request
When you type the URL http://localhost:3000 into your browser and hit Enter,
The browser interprets the URL. localhost tells the browser to communicate with 
a server on your own machine (the computer you're using).
:3000 specifies the port the browser should connect to. 

### Browser Resolves the Domain
For localhost, no actual network request leaves your machine. Instead,
your computerâ€™s operating system resolves localhost to 127.0.0.1 (the loopback IP address for your machine). This ensures that your browser connects to a server running locally.

### TCP Connection Established
The browser opens a TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) connection to the server on port 3000. This step is essential for data transmission between the browser and the server.

### Browser Sends an HTTP Request
The browser sends an HTTP request to the server.
For a basic request to http://localhost:3000, the request looks something like this:
```bash
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:3000
Connection: keep-alive
User-Agent: [Your browser's user agent]
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
```

### Key components of the request:
- HTTP Method: GET is the default method when you type a URL in the browser.
- Path: / represents the root of the server.
- Host: Specifies the server's domain and port (localhost:3000).
- Headers: Include metadata like browser type (User-Agent) and acceptable content types (Accept).

### Node.js Server Receives the Request
Your Node.js server (created with http.createServer) listens on port 3000 and receives the request.
The server processes the request using the provided callback function in http.
```javascript
createServer((req, res) => { ... }).
```
- req (Request): Contains details about the incoming request 
(e.g., method, headers, URL).
- res (Response): Used to send a response back to the browser.

### Server Sends an HTTP Response
The server sends an HTTP response back to the browser, which looks something 
like this:
```bash
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/plain
Content-Length: 13
Hello, World!
```
Key components of the response:
- Status Code: 200 OK indicates the request was successful.
- Headers: Metadata about the response (e.g., Content-Type: text/plain).
- Body: Contains the actual data (in this case, Hello, World!).

### Browser Receives the Response
The browser receives the response from the server and reads its contents:
- It interprets the HTTP status code (e.g., 200 to mean success).
- It processes the headers to understand how to handle the data (e.g.,
Content-Type tells the browser to treat the data as plain text).

### Browser Renders the Response
Based on the Content-Type header, the browser determines how to display the
response:
- For text/plain, it displays the raw text in the browser window.
- For more complex responses (e.g., HTML or JSON), the browser processes the content accordingly.
In this case, the browser displays:
```bash
Hello, World!
```

### Connection is Managed
- If the Connection: keep-alive header is present (as it typically is), the TCP connection remains open for further requests.
- If not, the connection closes after the response.
